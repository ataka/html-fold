;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides support for hiding and unhiding HTML elements.
;;
;; Acknowledgements:
;;
;; html-fold is developed based on tex-fold.el in AUCTeX, written by
;; Ralf Angeli <angeli@iwi.uni-sb.de>.
;;
;; Caveats:
;;
;; The display string of content which should display part of itself
;; is made by copying the text from the buffer together with its text
;; properties.  If fontification has not happened when this is done
;; (e.g. because of lazy or just-in-time font locking) the intended
;; fontification will not show up.  Maybe this could be improved by
;; using some sort of "lazy folding" or refreshing the window upon
;; scrolling.  As a workaround fontification of the whole buffer
;; currently is forced before folding it.
